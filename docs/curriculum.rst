About the Course
================

The RACECAR curriculum is designed as an introductory course in robotics for students with some programming experience. Each lab consists of a lecture, an exploration component, and a series of hands-on challenges. These labs grow in complexity, beginning with basic tasks such as driving in shapes and building to important concepts in robotics including SLAM, sensor fusion, and path planning.

This course also serves as a tutorial to the RACECAR platform. By working through the course, students will gain familiarity with the RACECAR hardware and racecar libraries.

Intended Audience
"""""""""""""""""

This course is primarily aimed toward students at the middle or high school level with some familiarity with the basics of Python. Students and instructors do not need to have any prior experience with robotics.
