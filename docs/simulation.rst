RacecarSim is a simulation environment created in Unity to emulate the physical RACECAR-MN.  It can serve as a testing environment, allowing users to safely and rapidly test software before deploying it to a physical car.  It also can serve as a substitute for the car, allowing students to complete the entire course without a RACECAR-MN.  The simulation contains a level for each lab, which includes obstacles and objectives corresponding to the lab content.

You can view and contribute to the source code of RacecarSim `here <https://github.com/MITLLRacecar/Simulation>`_.
